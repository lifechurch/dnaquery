# DNAQuery

[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/lifechurch/dnaquery)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/lifechurch/dnaquery) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lifechurch/dnaquery.svg?branch=cv%2Fcleanup_dirs)](https://travis-ci.org/lifechurch/dnaquery)

DNAQuery is a command line utility to take [LogDNA](https://logdna.com) archives and load them into [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/). This allows long-term, queryable storage of logs in BigQuery (which is considerably more cost effective). In our use case we want real-time access to lots of different logs, and long-term storage of a subset of those logs. This approach has helped us find a balance between access and cost.

## Getting Started

`go get -u github.com/lifechurch/dnaquery`

DNAQuery has been tested on Go v1.9

## Prerequisites

- a LogDNA account with [S3 Archiving](https://docs.logdna.com/docs/archiving) enabled
- a [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com) account

## Configuring

`cp example.toml dnaquery.toml`

Edit dnaquery.toml

All of these settings are currently required.

### AWS
Note: It's recommended that you create a new [IAM user](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home) with `s3:GetObject` permission on the LogDNA archive previously setup

```
[aws]
Key = "key123123123132" # Key for AWS IAM user
Secret = "secret123123123123" # Secret for AWS IAM user
Bucket = "logs" # name of bucket set in LogDNA archive setup above
LogPrefix = "a7112abc9d" # each archive file starts with a prefix specific to your LogDNA account
```

### Storage

```
[storage]
LogDirectory = 'logs' # temp local directory to download logs to and store results, this directory will be created if it doesn't exist
```

### Containers
Note: the term container here is used to be consistent with LogDNA's terminology
```
[[containers]]
    Name = "production-app"  # name of container
    Regex = '^([\d.]+) - \[([^\]]*)\] - - \[([^\]]*)\] "([^"]*)" (\d+) (\d+) "([^"]*)" "([^"]*)" (\d+) ([\d.]+)  ([\d.:]+) (\d+) ([\d.]+) (\d+)$'  # regex used to pull parts of logs out, currently we don't use any named capture groups
    TimeGroup = 3 # the number of the capture group (1-based) in above regex that holds the time component of the log
    TimeFormat = "2/Jan/2006:15:04:05 -0700" # the format of the time field using https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Parse
    [[containers.excludes]]  # an array of tables for exclusions
        Group = 4  # the number of the capture group in above regex to be used in the exclusion check
        Contains = "ping" # excludes logs if the value here is contained in the string in the above capture group
```

### GCP
```
[gcp]  # Google Cloud Project settings
ProjectID = "gcpproj" # name of GCP project
CredentialsFile = "gcp_credentials.json" # relative or absolute path to the credentials file downloaded from GCP
Bucket = "logdna_to_bq" # name of bucket in Google Cloud Storage to save results for ingestion into BigQuery, bucket will need to be created before first run
Dataset = "logdna" # BigQuery dataset
TemplateTable = "logdna" # currently DNAQuery uses a template table. More details below.
```

#### TemplateTable

Currently the schema for the BigQuery table is specified by creating a table with the schema that matches the regex. This is likely to change in the future as we may need a different schema for each container above.
